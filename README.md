# nap-demo

This docker-compose builds an NGINX instance in front of two Wordpress containers.
wp1 = myapp1.de       #Prod
wp2 = dev.myapp1.de   #Dev
NGINX stears traffic to the backend containers based on host name and restricts access to some administrative paths for the Prod environment.

For updates or rollbacks between Dev and Prod Ansible playbooks can be run.

------------------------------------

Preparations:

1. Adjust your dns (e.g. hosts file) to access:
myapp1.de
dev.myapp1.de

2. Enable public key authentication for ssh to run Ansible playbooks

>> ssh-keygen
>> ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/mykey user@host

3. Allow docker commands to run without sudo

>> sudo groupadd docker
>> sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated. If testing on a virtual machine, it may be necessary to restart the virtual machine for changes to take effect.

------------------------------------

Demo script:

>> git clone https://github.com/dfs5/nap-demo.git
>> cd nap-demo
>> docker-compose up -d
>> docker ps

In browser open: https://dev.myapp1.de and follow the Wordpress installation steps.

In browser open: https://myapp1.de to demonstrate that setup has been done only in Dev environment. You should receive "no access for you!" message in your browser.

Now let's run ansible playbook to copy Dev to Prod.
Under ansible --> inventory -->host make sure you have the right IP and username set:
   docker-node-ip ansible_user=username 
You can run ansible command or use the script:
>> update_myapp1.sh

In browser open: https://myapp1.de to demonstrate that myapp1 has been initially updated.

Now let's verify that WAF policy is up and in blocking mode. You can find the configuration of the policy in waf_pol/wp_01.json
In browser open: https://myapp1.de/?p=<script>
You should see the ASM blocking page.

Finally we want add some visibility. For this we add Kibana dashboard based on this repo but updated to the last release:
https://github.com/MattDierick/f5-waf-elk-dashboards

>> cd f5-waf-elk-dashboards
>> nano logstash/conf.d/30-waf-logs-full-logstash.conf
   hosts => ['localhost:9200']
>> docker-compose up -d

It takes a while for ELK stack to get ready. You can verify the start process with:
>> docker logs f5-waf-elk-dashboards_elasticsearch_1

Also check for issues if something goes wrong. In my case I needed to adjust virtual memory and modify docker-compose (already done):
max virtual memory areas vm.max_map_count [65530] is too low, increase to at least [262144]
max file descriptors [4096] for elasticsearch process is too low, increase to at least [65535]
>> sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
   vm.max_map_count=262144
>> sudo sysctl -p
>> docker-compose down
>> docker-compose up -d

Adjust app_protect_security_log in nginx.conf to point to ELK stack
>> cd ..
>> nano nginx.conf 
   app_protect_security_log "/home/log_all.json" syslog:server=xx.xx.xx.xx:5144;  #where x = docker node's IP
>> docker-compose down
>> docker-compose up -d

In browser open: http://docker-node-ip:5601

Kibana GUI should load. Select Dashboards in Menue and import both *.ndjson files from Kibana folder
- false-positives-dashboards.ndjson
- overview-dashboard.ndjson

In browser open: https://myapp1.de and browse through the app to generate some traffic.
In browser open: https://myapp1.de/?p=<script> 
and refresh screen view times to generate some blocking events.
Switch bach to Kibana --> Overview --> Dashboards to see the events.

Congratulates!!! - You are done with the Demo

------------------------------------

Possible Issues:

Issue - Ansible playbooks don't run
"msg": "Unable to load docker-compose. Try `pip install docker-compose`.
https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/docker-tip-74-curl-vs-pip-for-installing-docker-compose
"If you use any of Ansibleâ€™s docker_* modules, they depend on having the docker and / or docker-compose PIP packages installed..."

>> apt-get install python-pip
>> pip install --upgrade pip
>> pip install docker-compose

------------

Issue - leverage user to sudo when running a playbook
"msg": "Destination nap-demo/nginx_wp/migrate/wp1 not writable"}
use switch -K to run ansible playbook as root

>> ansible-playbook playbooks/update-myapp1-homepage.yaml -i inventory/hosts --key-file /Users/foitzik-schermann/.ssh/id_rsa -K

in playbook add
become: yes

-------------

Issue - lack of permissions to connect docker volume
>> docker logs 5649315d3cb7
bash: /var/log/app_protect/bd-socket-plugin.log: Permission denied
nginx: [error] APP_PROTECT { "event": "configuration_error", "error_message": "failed to open /var/log/app_protect/security.log (Permission denied)", "line_number": 22}

I make it works creating ./logs/app_protect with 777 permission in advance.
sudo chmod -R 777 logs/app_protect/

-------------

Issue - elasticsearch
max file descriptors [4096] for elasticsearch process is too low, increase to at least [65535]
The following added to the docker-compose file:
    ulimits:
      nofile:
         soft: 65536
         hard: 65536
